# Memory Game Project

hi

This project, a browser-based card matching game, was developed as part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. The project guidelines called for an application that recreates the real-life functionality of card games such as Concentration and Memory, in which a pair of cards are flipped per turn in the hope of finding a match. The application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The app is built with the following code dependencies:

1. Font Awesome
2. CSS font (family=Coda)
3. Using sweetalert2
 from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/sweetalert2/3.0.3/sweetalert2.min.css

4. Adding animate.css from https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/3.5.2/animate.css

5. jQuery

This is a complete browser-based card matching game.

In Each turn:
The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

How to Run:
